      <p>Registration is open to adults with autism, parents/legal guardians of a child or adult with autism,
        and professionals. After you join Autism DRIVE, we will be able to share information with you about research
        studies that may be a good fit. Participating in any of these studies is optional. You will also be matched
        with resources and upcoming events in your community.

      <h2>Joining the Autism DRIVE is FREE!</h2>
      <p>Registration takes about 10 minutes and involves answering a few questions about yourself and/or your family
        member if you are enrolling your child or dependent. If you donâ€™t finish all the questions, you can save your
        progress and come back later. You can also change and update your information at any time. If you want to
        cancel your account, you can let us know by emailing us.

      <h2>Any information you share will be kept private</h2>
      <p>Only autism researchers at the University of Virginia will be able to see your information. We will only use
        your information to connect you with research opportunities and resources. Because of this, researchers may
        contact you about research studies that you may be interested in.
