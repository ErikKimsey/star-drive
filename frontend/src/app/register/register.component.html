      <h1>Why should I join?</h1>
      <p>By joining the Registry, we will be able to let you know about resources and upcoming events in your community.
        We can also match you with research opportunities that might be a good fit for you and your family. Your
        participation will help us learn more about autism so we can create new solutions to achieve positive outcomes. </p>

    <div fxFlex.gt-md="50%">
      <h1>What does it involve?</h1>
      <p>We will ask you to answer some questions about yourself or your family member with autism.  We will use this
        information to provide you with the most relevant information about resources and upcoming studies.
        These questions should take about 10-15 minutes. If you donâ€™t finish all the questions at once, you can
        save your progress and return later.  You can also come back and modify your information or cancel your
        account at any time.</p>
