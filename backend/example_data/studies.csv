Function-Based Video Self-Modeling to the Treat Disruptive Behavior of Individuals with Autism.,"For students who have had minimal success on current behavior plans, this study explored the effects of using applied behavior analysis procedures to inform a video self-modeling treatment. Participants starred in their own movie, portraying appropriate behavior amidst conditions that typically triggered disruptive behavior. Participation involved watching the video 1 time per day and completing their regular classroom activities.","Individuals with autism aged 3 to 45 years old. Individuals who are unable to attend to a video screen for at least 30 seconds (e.g., computer, tablet) will be excluded.","Immediate benefits include access to a video starring the individual that can be accessed on a phone, tablet, or computer. The long-term benefits of this project are a decrease in problem behavior and an increase in appropriate behavior",Virginia Institute of Autism,"This project takes place at the Virginia Institute of Autism, school, out-patient clinic, and adult services.",Study In Progress,Kate M.

Feasibility of Using a New Behavior Analytic Procedure (Interview Informed Synthesized Contingency Analysis [IISCA]) to Inform Treatment Decisions,Disruptive behavior in adults with autism is difficult to manage due to long reinforcement histories. This project aimed to decrease disruptive behavior and increase social engagement for adults with autism using an applied behavior analysis procedure. Participants will be observed under conditions that typically trigger problem behavior and positive reinforcement will be provided.,Individuals with autism and/or developmental disabilities aged 3 to 45. Individuals without problem behavior will be excluded.,Benefits include a detailed analysis of why problem behavior occurs and an intervention specifically tailored to increase communication and social opportunities.,Virginia Institute of Autism,"This study will take place at the Virginia Institute of Autism, school, out-patient behavior clinic, and adult services.",Study In Progress,Kate M.

Improving Compliance with Dental Examinations for Individuals with Autism.,"Dental examinations are an essential part of preventative health services. Lack of appropriate dental care can have detrimental health-related consequences, as well associated discomfort. The intervention consists of gradually introducing the steps of the dental examination and will include basic dental hygiene and simulated x-rays.",Individuals with autism aged 5 to 45. Exclusion criteria includes individuals who do not demonstrate disruptive behavior during dental examinations.,Benefits of this project include dental cleanings and examinations from a local dentist at no charge. Long term benefits include improved oral health.,Virginia Institute of Autism,"Sessions will take place at the Virginia Institute of Autism, out-patient behavior clinic and Children's Dentistry of Charlottesville.",Currently Enrolling,Kate M.

"Therapeutic and diagnostic potential of targeting microRNAs in
 autism","The study seeks to understand the mechanism of how parental and gestational exposure to environmental factors contribute to autism. Based on preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that the transgenerational transmission of autism traits is programmed by small non-coding RNAs such as microRNA. In this study, we will define the microRNA expression signature in a mouse model of Maternal-Immune-Activation (MIA)-induced autism, and interrogate a functional role for microRNA dysregulation in autism.",, ,University of Virginia,University of Virginia,Study In Progress,Anindya Dutta,"Ph.D., Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics",University of Virginia,,John Lukens,"Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Neuroscience",University of Virginia,,Zhangli Su,"Ph.D., Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics",University of Virginia,,Assessment and Diagnosis,Treatment and Therapies ,    Genetic Conditions ,,,All Ages
